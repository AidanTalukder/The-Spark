# The Spark: A Computer Science Pet Project and GM-Made Tool for The First of Latanach: A West Marches Pathfinder 2e TTRPG Campaign
The Spark is a simple Discord bot with an evolving suite of functionalities. This micro-project began with a simple string randomizer; each player gave me four rumors about their characters that I then randomly shuffled and doled out to the rest of the group. That task evolved into: "What if that process was entirely automated?" / "What if I turned a 15-minute task into a 3 hour one where I learn Discord's developer API for fun?" Thus, The Spark was born.

The Spark aims to offer the following functions:
- [ X ] Rumor distribution
- [ X ] Individual and batch messaging to server members
- [ - ] Role-based availability tracking
- [ - ] Secret player-to-player messages with no GM oversight

The Spark is extremely developer-reliant. Its functionality was initially limited to manually performed calls for specific tasks, such as messaging players individually or in bulk, though that changed with the introduction of a role-based availability tracker. My players are heavily invested into the game and many of them play twice or even three times in a single week (and I love them dearly for it). I want a way for players to be marked as "On Mission" or "On Break" through use of Discord's roles system. In this way, players can organize groups with the understanding of who has already gone on a mission this week at a glance, increasing weekly player throughput and participation in quieter individuals who may have otherwise gotten steamrolled by louder, more involved ones (this is not a bad thing whatsoever, merely a characteristic of circumstance).
